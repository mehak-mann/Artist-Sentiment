# Artist Sentiment Analysis
## Overview

1. Open up the program in the IDE of your choice and
run it, inputting the name of the artist whose sentiment you want
to evaluate.
2. When program finishes running, check the folder for
a matplotlib figure named: "<Artist-Name>: Song Sentiment Over Time"

Note: Does not run with newer versions of Python due to usage of datetime64.
